             Hawaii Here I come!âœˆ</em></h1>
            <P> I'm happy I was given this opportunity to be apart of Launchcode.
               I've always had a curiosity about how to make a web page or start an app.
               I also wanted to challenge myself in a way that I have never been challenge before.<br/>
               LaunchCode is the beginning of something different, new, and challenging.
               After completing Launchcode I want to go on a trip to celebrate my accomplishment.
               So Hawaii <em>&#34HERE I COME&#34!</em></P>
