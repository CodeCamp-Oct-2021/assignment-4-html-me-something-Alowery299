         <article> I'm happy I was given this opportunity to be apart of Launchcode.<br/>
         I've always had a curiosity about how to make a web page or start an app.<br/>
      I also wanted to challenge myself in a way that I have never been challenge before.<br/>
    LaunchCode is the beginning of something different, new, and challenging.<br/>
    After completing Launchcode I want to go on a trip to celebrate my accomplishment.<br/> 
    So Hawaii <em>&#34HERE I COME&#34!</em>
